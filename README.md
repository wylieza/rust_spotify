# Rust Spotify Bot

## About this project
**This is my first project using the rust language**. A simple utility for interacting with Spotify.
This is aimed at being both functional (meeting a specific need I have) and a learning experiance (gaining
exposure to the rust language).

## Latest 100 playlist
I would like to have a playlist which is kept up to date with the most recent 100 songs I have collected.
Essentially, regardless of which playlist I add a new song, the 'latest 100 playlist' will be updated to
contain this new track.
There should be no duplicates and there should be an option to exclude playlists from seeding.
